# Test Sidechain Functionalities With Sphere by Horizen


This is my report and compilation of necessary steps to test the functionalities of the sidechain and perform a forward transfer from the mainchain to the sidechain.

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04.1
- **Sphere By Horizen**: [v2.0.0](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen_Sidechain_Testnet/releases/download/desktop-v2.0.0-beta-sidechain-testnet/Sphere_by_Horizen_Sidechain_Testnet-2.0.0-beta.deb)

## Download & Install .deb - Auth

The truth is that this process was too easy. And the registration is intuitive.

I first created an account and then logged in.
