# Test Sidechain Functionalities With Sphere by Horizen

This is my report and compilation of necessary steps to test the functionalities of the sidechain and perform a forward transfer from the mainchain to the sidechain.

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04.1
- **Sphere By Horizen**: [v2.0.0](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen_Sidechain_Testnet/releases/download/desktop-v2.0.0-beta-sidechain-testnet/Sphere_by_Horizen_Sidechain_Testnet-2.0.0-beta.deb)

## Download & Install .deb - Auth 🔐

The truth is that this process was too easy. And the registration is intuitive.

I first created an account and then logged in.

## Wait for Sync 🕐

Once I log in, I have to wait for it to sync with the network.

This is a time consuming process.

**How viable would it be to create a fast captchup or maybe a lightweight node?**

I know it is not a safe option, but for entry developers and testing the technology would be a great advantage.

This process has very good UX.👌🏻

## Obtain free test ZEN (tZEN) 🤩

> Too bad they are only test coins.😓
